Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
 The "this" keyword has four principles: window binding, implicit binding, new binding, and explicit binding.. In window binding the "this" is the console Object when in a global scope. In implicit binding the "this" is the Object to the right of the dot. In new binding the "this" is the "new" Object that gets created and inherits the original Object. In a way it uses the original Object as a template that is then used by each "new" added Object.In explicit binding the "this" is the object which uses methods call and apply to help it gain attributes from other arrays.
